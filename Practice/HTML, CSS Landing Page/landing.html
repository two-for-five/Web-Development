		<h1> Welcome to the Beach</h1>
		<p>I typically enjoy a beautiful beach destination, as I find the water and sand to be the most replenishing.</p>

		<p>A good vacation for me is going to warm weather. Being able to go outside, in the sun, hit the beach, play outside sports. Being active outside. Going swimming, hanging by the pool, having a couple drinks, having a couple of your close buddies around, and just having a blast.</p>

		<p>Another thing I like to do is sit back and take in nature. To look at the birds, listen to their singing, go hiking, camping and jogging and running, walking along the beach, playing games and sometimes being alone with the great outdoors. It's very special to me.</p>
